== Project Details ==

The project will require the initial step of porting Processing.js automated test suite created by David Humphrey. That will produce a framework for which the C3DL demos can be added. The framework will need to be tailored for the project needs, such as: moving demos need to be integrated, replacing Processing.js still frame demos with C3DL ones.
