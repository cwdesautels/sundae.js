== Project Details ==

Create an easy to implement multi platform framework with the intent to compare webGL canvases and/or webGL buffers with known good or known bad results. Additionally the focus will be on webGL functionality relevant to c3dl, and c3dl rendered canvases.

== Project Plan ==

0.4
- Clearly identify the test process, and approach
- Rewrite framework defining and separating the testing sequence
- Update readPixels()
- Confirm pixel comparison and blur() actually work
0.5
- Implement howto test webGL fundamentals. Both rendered and buffered objects.
- Develop relevant webGL test cases
- Break c3dl tests into more fundamental tests. Isolating very specific objects.
0.6
- Port test cases into their own files
- Implement importing test case files
- Define rigid organizational structure, directory and tag based import system.
0.7
- Enhance optimization with worker threads
- Identify locations for multiple threads and strategy of use
- Implement multi thread support
0.8
- Implement Windows operating system support with all browsers
- Implement relevant webGL test cases for Windows and specific browsers, including known fails.
0.9
- Implement Apple operating system support with all browsers
- Implement relevant webGL test cases for Apple and specific browsers, including known fails.
1.0
- Implement Linux operating system support with all browsers
- Implement relevant webGL test cases for Linux and specific browser, including known fails.
- Polish code logic: remove unnecessary runtime
